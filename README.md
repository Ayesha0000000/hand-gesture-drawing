# hand-gesture-drawing
This project uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to track hand gestures via webcam, enabling real-time virtual drawing with your index finger. It features a smooth line drawing on a transparent canvas without background ghosting. Ideal for gesture-based interaction, creative applications, and AI-powered virtual whiteboards.
